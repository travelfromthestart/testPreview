Welcome! I'm glad you're here!

In writing this blog, I aim to support the parent who loves to travel, but is intimidated by the idea of doing it with small kids. Here, you'll find practical tips for the beginner, from a beginner. I'm a mom of two young kids, figuring it out along the way. I'm here to tell you what worked and what didn't, as I experiment to combine my passions for parenthood and travel. 

**What makes me qualified?**

I'm figuring it out as you are! But here's what informs my writing:

* I'm an experienced lifelong traveler with a passion for seeing new places. I myself have been traveling from a young age, starting with my parents and my sibling. I managed to study abroad twice during my four years in undergrad. I know how it feels to be motivated and energized by travel. This blog is written for and by the person who plans the next trip on the flight home from the prior one (this drives my husband nuts… sorry, honey!). Through the years, I've traveled solo, with family, with friends, with my husband, for work, for play, and now as the one with the reins for a family with young kids. I love learning about new places and the people who live there. One of my favorite things is finding an absolutely breathtaking view. There you'll find me slowing down and taking it all in… and if the view really rocks, tearing up with gratitude. You won't find me in as many museums or on guided tours (but if that's your thing, I say go for it!). 
* I'm a child development expert. My day job involves a doctoral degree that helps me understand brain development and child behavior. This is shaping how I approach travel with my own young kids. Travel is an opportunity to learn things about myself and about my kids. 

My favorite places I've traveled include Portugal, the Yucatan (honorable mention Oaxaca!), Cameroon, Iceland, Italy, and Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland! I'm no photographer, but the photos you'll find on my site are my own. I have found SO many breathtaking views and can't wait to capture more.

Here, you'll find my tips and tricks for travel with a young family. I'll review specific trips and sites we've seen as well as give you my lessons learned along the way.
I can't wait to make these memories with my people. I hope some of these tips can be helpful for your family too! Travel with young kids is hard… let's work together to find some ways to make it easier and even more rewarding. Buckle up… and happy travels!
