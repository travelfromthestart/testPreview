So far, in traveling with our two young kids, we’ve done road trips and flights, weekend getaways and longer trips. Sometimes we’re going on a trip to meet up with friends, visit family, or see a place we’ve never been. These variables all change what you will need and what makes the most sense to pack, so each of those pieces need to be factored into your packing list. However, this post is meant to give you some packing ideas, regardless of which of these types of trips you’re taking. This is not a comprehensive packing list (separate post on this topic coming soon… we created a reusable version!), but meant to give you creative ideas about how to make travel with babies and toddlers easier.

Here are some products to consider:

1. **Books.** We always bring a few books when we travel. Reading books is a part of our bedtime routine, but I’ve also found them to be helpful for passing time on airplanes or while waiting in airports. Over time, I’ve learned that my favorite travel books are a) light, b) packable, and c) resistant to damage when stowed away in a bag. A couple of our favorites are Indestructibles, especially for babies and young toddlers ([like this](https://amzn.to/4ljbr2s) or [this](https://amzn.to/3HrxW7l)) and these Daniel Tiger mini hardback books that come with the Daniel Tiger Storyteller ([link here](https://amzn.to/4fsQCjI)). I am a big fan of the Daniel Tiger series overall, and this storyteller is very well done. We received one as a gift and it remains an absolute favorite in our house (for non-travel days too!). The storyteller is great for road trips if family is okay with listening along, but it’s not a good airplane toy. The books alone are really great for travel, including airplanes. They are lightweight, compact, and hardback yet tiny, so they check all the boxes. 

2. **YOTO Mini with headphones.** [link](https://amzn.to/3Jq0vmg). We don’t own this product yet, but it’s on our wishlist, maybe for our next gift-giving occasion. We have used friends’ Yoto minis and found them to have a great variety of content and to be pretty compact for travel. We have a [Tonie box](https://amzn.to/3JqrKNv) at home, which we love, but I find the size to be bulky for travel in a backpack or suitcase (does okay on a road trip though!). 

3. **Tablet.** I’ll have a few posts on screens and tablets for travel, but overall, though we use next to no screen time at home, I think it can be helpful for travel when used in smart ways. Basically I see these ([iPads](https://amzn.to/45o9hZq), [Kindle Fires](https://amzn.to/45tLM1i), etc.) to be a tool for occasional help while traveling, when paired with a good set of kids headphones ([like these](https://amzn.to/4fy9SfZ) - double check that the headphone jack matches your device(s)!). We do try not to rely on them completely. That is, these are mostly reserved for Plan B rather than Plan A. I do this because I think too much screen time can be a source of crankiness in kids and toddlers, even in the short term, and in many scenarios, that may not be worth the very short-term benefit (though sometimes it absolutely could be). I also prefer lower stimulation games, but more on that later. Finally, no traveling toddler (or child… or adult, for that matter) should be traveling without a protective case ([iPad](https://amzn.to/45aPQEF) or [Kindle Fire](https://amzn.to/47o6v97) - again, check to ensure you have the right case for the generation you have).

4. **Sleep gear.** For us, this includes a Hatch sound machine ([for your destination](https://amzn.to/45ol9KT)), but we also often travel with a portable sound machine for naps or on-the-go ([link](https://amzn.to/46RFGtW); they also bundle [these two products](https://amzn.to/45ADt3Q)). We opt for very small [stuffed](https://amzn.to/3J7uwHp) [animals](https://amzn.to/4loEoKt) that the girls can access on flights and once we get to our destination. If we have a major attachment to a stuffed animal (particularly sentimental), we leave them at home so we can’t lose them. Some also like [this blackout tent](https://amzn.to/3UXYPms). We try to travel pretty light, but some families swear by these. It can also be helpful to have a great travel crib like [this](https://amzn.to/4m3SCS5) or [this](https://amzn.to/3Jp5pjo), but again, we try to travel light and opt to stay in places that have the sleeping arrangements we’ll need on-site. 

5. **Travel tripod.** Although we love to travel light, in my opinion, this one is worth the luggage space. Having family memories captured in pictures is priceless. Asking people to stop and take photos that never turn out well anyway is not worth the hassle in my opinion. Packing a [tripod](https://amzn.to/45t3kKI) can be a good solution!

6. **Power bank.** This one is already on your radar, no doubt, but I would be remiss to leave it off this list. In my opinion, the time between when you land at your first destination and when you arrive at your first hotel can easily be the most stressful moments of the trip. You thought you had a plan. But what was the name of the bus route? Wait, there are no signs for the bus within the airport and you don’t speak the language? Oh hang on, which number bus do we need? Yes, it goes to our destination, but which stop is ours? When I say this part of your trip planning should be rock solid, I mean it. No holes. BUT arriving to your destination with a perfectly crafted plan, but said plan is on your cell phone at 10% battery? Once again, let’s not. Try [this](https://amzn.to/4mehsic) or [this](https://amzn.to/45GxmvQ), depending on your preference. 

7. **[Packing](https://amzn.to/47n4LNm) [cubes](https://amzn.to/3UVkpbi).** Are they worth the hype? Yes. In my opinion, absolutely. Try for yourself. 

8. **Snacks.** Snacks prevent hangry toddlers and double as entertainment. What’s not to love? Pack double what you think you’ll need and then restock at your first destination. My girls are snackers, but I think this is a universal staple for toddlers. Lots of people love fancy snack containers like [this](https://amzn.to/45b2of9) or [this](https://amzn.to/4ovvUnk). I have [this one](https://amzn.to/4lk2pCc) and like it a lot for park snacks/picnics and even road trips, but it’s not a plane item for us. It doesn’t earn its keep in a backpack, since it’s pretty bulky. Additionally, it’s likely to be empty at points in your trip and may be a pain to clean depending on your accommodations and travel schedule. Instead, we opt for good old fashioned ziploc bags (or [the reusable version](https://amzn.to/45rBDC9) - we opt for silicone and dishwasher safe). 

9. **Other eating necessities.** This will of course vary by age. If your child is young, this may include a [pump](https://amzn.to/3UlRuwU)  (this was my favorite, especially for travel, but see if your insurance covers part or all of this!), cleaning supplies ([Medela sanitizing bag](https://amzn.to/47mfCXN), [cleaning wipes](https://amzn.to/46RG7EA), [travel soap](https://amzn.to/4mtGc5C)), bottles, etc. When your child is eating food/solids, the game changes and the packing list varies a bit by the child's age (and how clean they can be while eating). Some good items to consider include bibs (we like [these super packable ones](https://amzn.to/45x7OAc)) and [sticky one-time use placemats](https://amzn.to/3Jbdo3w). If your child has a food allergy, here’s my reminder to pack the EpiPen!

10. **Medications.** We try to pack our daily meds and vitamins in addition to some just-in-case options. For example, we have an upcoming cruise, so we’re bringing child and adult Dramamine options this time. We bring a pain reliever/fever reducer, seasonal allergy meds, and Tums, among others. I just purchased a [travel case](https://amzn.to/3J7Unza) to keep all our meds labeled and organized. It has arrived and I've packed our meds up for our next trip, so I’m excited to see how we like it, but so far it seems helpful. It is nice and compact but each compartment is small, so this is something to keep in mind (the Tums, for example, were a tights squeeze but we don’t take these regularly so I was okay with packing only a couple). 

Every family will have differences in what works best for them. I hope this list helps prompt some ideas to help make your next travel day easier! Happy travels!
