Picture this:
You’re on a flight with your busy-body toddler (or [gasp] TWO!). A typical day at home involves movement, activity, endless snacks, and a just-right nap set-up to curate a smooth day. Now you’re aiming to do that in a flying metal tube with too-little legroom and a seatbelt sign conveniently dinging on every time you hear “Mommy, I have to go potty!”

Maybe you’re gearing up for your first-ever flight with a toddler. Or maybe it’s your first solo flight. Maybe you’ve done shorter flights but you’re gearing up for a longer one. Or maybe you’ve done this before, but you’re seeking new advice based on a not-so-smooth experience in the past, in need of some fresh ideas or problem-solving. 

*How will I keep them occupied?*

*What if they scream?*

*What should I bring to make this travel day go smoothly?*

I would argue that a lot of the important work is the prep work (browse my site for more on this topic), but there is no debate, a well-stocked activity backpack can make or break the flight. This article contains my master list of ideas to help you prepare and walk into that flight with the confidence of a seasoned pro.

My goal is not to have you purchase more products, so let’s start with what makes a good travel toy, so you can first shop your own toy closet!

Here’s what we’re looking for (ideally each toy fits not one but all of the following):
- **Compact**
- **Durable**
- **Separate pieces?** They must either be attached, or the show must go on without them (leave your puzzles at home!). Dig in the seat just one time and you’ll be permanently sworn off of them.
- **Quiet** (for others’ sake) and ideally not overstimulating (for your sake and your child’s)
- **Entertaining**
- **Minimal mess**

Have something that fits the bill? If so, start there. I recommend taking them off your toy shelf at least a month before your trip (longer if your kids are more than a couple years old) so that the toys feel novel when the trip rolls around. Bonus: this is a nice way to get a head start on your packing anyway… nothing worse than something you can’t pack until the morning of the trip!

Wishing you safe and happy travels, wherever your next trip takes you!
